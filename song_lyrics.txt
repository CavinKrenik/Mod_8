PEARL JAM - EVEN FLOW

Freezin'
Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin'
Maybe he'll see a little better, set of days, ooh, yeah
Oh, hand out
Faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ooh, yeah
Oh, dark grin
He can't help, when he's happy he looks insane, hm, yeah
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away (ooh)
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again
Kneelin'
Lookin' through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh, yeah
Oh, prayin'
Now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin'
Understands the weather of the winter's on its way
Oh, ceilings
Few and far between all the legal halls of shame, hey
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Ah, whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away
Yeah!
Whoo! Ah, yeah
Fuck it up
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again, yeah
Oh, whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away
Yeah!
Whoo! Ah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, mama mami!
